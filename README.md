# PingPong

This is a simple RESTful app with Spring Boot and Spring Security.

How it works: 
Client sends "ping" to server and gets "pong" from it with the number of calls from this client.

For tests execution you need to configurate your postgresDB as it is configured in resources/application.properties, clone and run this proj + I created testAuthRest.html-file to test the app (so you can use any server-side you want to ).
